If we shadows have offended,
think but this and all is mended,
that you have but slumbered here,
while these visions did appear.
And this weak and idle theme,
no more yielding but a dream.
Gentles do not reprehend,
if you pardon, we will mend.
And as I am an honest Puck,
if we have unerned luck,
now to scape the serpents tongue,
we will make amends ere' long.
Else the Puck a liar call.
So good night unto you all.
Give me your hands if we be friends,
and Robin shall make amends.
